# Prime Number Theorem: Data Analysis Project

## Mathematical Background

### Overview

The **Prime Number Theorem (PNT)** is one of the most profound results in analytic number theory, established independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la VallÃ©e Poussin in 1896. This theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers among the positive integers, formalizing the intuitive observation that primes become increasingly sparse as numbers grow larger.

### Theorem Statement

Let Ï€(x) denote the **prime counting function**, which counts the number of primes less than or equal to x. The Prime Number Theorem states that:

**Ï€(x) ~ x/ln(x) as x â†’ âˆž**

More precisely:
```
lim[xâ†’âˆž] Ï€(x)/(x/ln(x)) = 1
```

This asymptotic equivalence means that for large x, the probability that a randomly chosen integer near x is prime is approximately 1/ln(x).

### Historical Context

- **1792-1793**: Carl Friedrich Gauss conjectured the asymptotic formula based on empirical observations
- **1896**: Independent proofs by Hadamard and de la VallÃ©e Poussin using complex analysis
- **1949**: Elementary proofs (not using complex analysis) by Atle Selberg and Paul ErdÅ‘s
- **1980**: Simplified proof by Donald J. Newman using basic complex analysis

### Improved Approximations

While x/ln(x) gives the correct asymptotic behavior, more accurate approximations exist:

#### Logarithmic Integral
The **logarithmic integral** li(x) provides a superior approximation:
```
li(x) = âˆ«[2 to x] dt/ln(t)
```

In practice, li(x) consistently overestimates Ï€(x) but with much smaller relative error than x/ln(x).

#### Riemann's R(x)
An even more sophisticated approximation is Riemann's R(x):
```
R(x) = Î£[k=1 to âˆž] Î¼(k)/k Ã— li(x^(1/k))
```
where Î¼(k) is the MÃ¶bius function.

### Connection to the Riemann Hypothesis

The Prime Number Theorem is intimately connected to the **Riemann zeta function**:
```
Î¶(s) = Î£[n=1 to âˆž] 1/n^s = Î [p prime] 1/(1-p^(-s))
```

The proof relies on showing that Î¶(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1. The famous **Riemann Hypothesis** conjectures that all non-trivial zeros lie on the line Re(s) = 1/2, which would imply much stronger error bounds for Ï€(x).

### Implications and Applications

1. **Cryptography**: Helps estimate the density of primes needed for RSA and other cryptographic algorithms
2. **Number Theory**: Provides insight into the fundamental structure of integers
3. **Analytic Number Theory**: Foundation for more advanced results about prime distribution
4. **Prime Gaps**: Predicts that the average gap between consecutive primes near x is approximately ln(x)

### Related Conjectures and Results

#### Twin Prime Conjecture
The density of twin primes (primes p such that p+2 is also prime) is conjectured to be asymptotically:
```
Ï€â‚‚(x) ~ 2Câ‚‚ Ã— x/(ln(x))Â²
```
where Câ‚‚ â‰ˆ 0.66016 is the twin prime constant.

#### Goldbach Conjecture
Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. While unproven, the Prime Number Theorem provides probabilistic evidence for its truth.
